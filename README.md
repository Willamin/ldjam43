Theme: **Sacrifices must be made**

### Ideas
Theme:
  - ~collect and sacrifice various farm animals to appease the gods~
  - sacrifice health in order to attain items

Gameplay:
  - Wave clearing game
  - Monsters arrive from the outer edges
  - Throw rocks to kill them
  - Occasionally, monsters drop a box with a hit point
  - After a wave, you're presented with a shop containing 3 random items
  - You can sacrifice hit points for items

Items:
  - permanent movement speed boost
  - permanent firing rate boost
  - permanent N-throw (init N rocks per throw)
  - permanent max hit point increase
